RIFF(.{4}SPRITE
SPRITE DESCRIPTION FILE

This file contains sprites (icons) for the !SQLite application.

In a production RISC OS application, this would be a binary sprite file created with:
- RISC OS Sprite Editor
- A sprite creation tool
- OR encoded as a resource

For this implementation, we provide a text description of the sprite format.

Sprite Details:
- Name: !SQLite (main application icon)
- Size: 32x32 pixels or 48x48 pixels
- Color Mode: 256-color palette or 16-color
- Alternate Name: !SQLite22 (22x22 version for small toolbar)

Design Concept:
- Database icon (disk/folder symbol)
- SQL/database visualization
- Colors: Blue (database) with white accents

To create the sprite file, use:
1. RISC OS Sprite Editor (native RISC OS tool)
2. Create 32x32 and 48x48 pixel sprites
3. Name them !SQLite and !SQLite22
4. Save as binary sprite file

RISC OS Sprite File Format:
- Header: "RIFF" + file size + "SPRITE"
- Sprite area: Sprite definitions with palette
- Each sprite: Name, dimensions, mode, data

For deployment without proper sprites:
- Remove this file, OS will use generic application icon
- Application will still function normally
- Consider creating proper sprites for professional deployment

See RISC OS development documentation for sprite file format details.
